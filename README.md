# üåçInter-Planetary Communicationü™ê

The project aims to establish communication between Earth and Mars by translating messages between plain English and encoded Nokia mobile keypad digits. Earth's messages are converted into numeric series for Mars, and Mars' messages are decoded into English for Earth. This innovative approach bridges the gap between the two worlds, enabling seamless communication across distant planets.
